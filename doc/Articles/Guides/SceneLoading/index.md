# Loading scenes in Mirage

Use [NetworkSceneManager](./NetworkSceneManager.md) to help load scenes and sync them between server and client.

To customize scene handling you can make a subclass and override the virtual methods.

If you need more unique logic to load scenes you can have full control by following this [guide](./Manual.md).
