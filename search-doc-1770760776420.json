There are two kinds of authority for networked animation (see documentation on Network Authority): note Animator Triggers are not synced directly. Call NetworkAnimator.SetTrigger instead. A game object with authority can use the SetTrigger function to fire an animation trigger on other clients. If the game object has authority over the client, you should animate it locally on the client that owns the game object. That client sends the animation state information to the server, which broadcasts it to all the other clients. For example, this may be suitable for player characters with client authority.If the game object has authority on the server, then you should animate it on the server. The server then sends state information to all clients.

All character objects are always first spawned in the main scene, which may or may not have visual content, networked objects, etc. With SceneVisibilityChecker attached to all networked objects, whenever the character object is moved to a sub-scene (from the main or another sub-scene) using MoveToScene, the observer's lists for objects in both the new scene and the prior scene are updated accordingly.

This is typically handled by the SyncVar attributes on the IsReady field within the ReadyCheck script, which ensures the value is set on the owner client and reset on the server when LobbyReady.SetAllClientsNotReady() is called. "},{"title":"Usage​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Ready Check and Lobby Ready","url":"docs/components/ready-check#usage","content":"Setting Player Ready​ To set a player as ready, you can simply update the IsReady field of their ReadyCheck component to true. This can be done either manually through code, or through user input such as a &quot;Ready&quot; button. Mirage will then sync this change to server and other clients. For example: readyCheck.SetReady(true);  Reacting to Ready changes​ When the IsReady field of a player's ReadyCheck component is changed, the OnReadyChanged event is invoked on all clients to reflect the new value. You can subscribe to this event and perform actions based on the player's ready state. For example, you can update UI elements to show the player's current ready status: public class ReadyUI : MonoBehaviour { public ReadyCheck ReadyCheck; public Image Image; public void Start() { ReadyCheck.OnReadyChanged += OnReadyChanged; // invoke right away to set the current value OnReadyChanged(ReadyCheck.IsReady); } private void OnReadyChanged(bool ready) { Image.color = ready ? Color.green : Color.red; } }  Sending Messages to Ready Players​ To send a message to all players that are ready, you can use the LobbyReady.SendToReady function. Here's an example: [NetworkMessage] // Make sure to regieter message on client public struct MyMessage { public string message; } public class LobbyController : MonoBehaviour { public LobbyReady LobbyReady; public void SendToReady() { var myMessage = new MyMessage { message = &quot;Hello, world!&quot; }; // Send message to ready players LobbyReady.SendToReady(myMessage); } }  You can also send messages to not ready players by setting the sendToReady parameter to false. Note that this function only sends messages to players that have ReadyCheck attached to their character and are synced with the server. public void SendToNotReady() { var myMessage = new MyMessage { message = &quot;Hello, world!&quot; }; // Send message to ready players LobbyReady.SendToReady(myMessage, sendToReady: false); }  Resetting Ready​ Resetting Ready State for All Players You can reset the IsReady field for all players by calling LobbyReady.SetAllClientsNotReady(). Here's an example: public void ClearReady() { LobbyReady.SetAllClientsNotReady(); }  This will set the IsReady field to false for all ReadyCheck on the server, the values will then be synced to client.

"},{"title":"Client Side​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Authenticator Settings","url":"docs/guides/authentication/authenticator-settings#client-side","content":"On the client side, you need to use the SendAuthentication method provided by the authenticator to send a message to the server. This is necessary because most authenticators require additional information, such as player login details. The SendAuthentication method ensures that the authentication message is properly wrapped and sent to the server. It should be used instead of directly calling player.Send, as the authenticator message is wrapped in an internal AuthMessage message. However, it's important to note that authenticators typically should not call the SendAuthentication method automatically themselves. Instead, you can create an additional component, such as the CreateSession component for the SessionIdAuthenticator class, to handle the automatic invocation of SendAuthentication. The CreateSession component can be responsible for initiating the authentication process and automatically calling the SendAuthentication method when needed. This allows the authenticator to automatically use the session token provided by the server for seamless reconnection. Keep in mind that it is recommended to use only one authenticator with this automatic behavior, as the server processes only one authentication per player. By separating the responsibility of calling SendAuthentication to an extra component, you can have more flexibility and control over the authentication flow, while ensuring that authenticators focus on their core functionality.

Using synchronized networked game objects, you can create a shared experience for all the players who are playing an instance of your game. They see and hear the same events and actions - even though that may be from their own unique viewpoints within your game. Multiplayer games in Mirage are typically built using Scenes that contain a mix of networked game objects and regular (non-networked) game objects. The networked game objects are those which move or change during gameplay in a way that needs to be synchronized across all users who are playing the game together. Non-networked game objects are those that either don't move or change at all during gameplay (for example, static obstacles like rocks or fences) or game objects which have movement or changes that don’t need to be synchronized across players (for example, a gently swaying tree or clouds passing by in the background of your game). A networked game object is one that has a Network Identity component attached. However, a Network Identity component alone is not enough for your game object to be functional and active in your multiplayer game. The Network Identity component is the starting point for synchronization, and it allows the Network Manager to synchronize the creation and destruction of the game object, but other than that, it does not specify which properties of your game object should be synchronized. What exactly should be synchronized on each networked game object depends on the type of game you are making, and what each game object’s purpose is. Some examples of what you might want to synchronize are: The position and rotation of moving game objects such as the players and non-player characters.The animation state of an animated game objectThe value of a variable, for example, how much time is left in the current round of a game, or how much energy a player has. As a convenience, the initial position, rotation, and scale of the object are automatically synchronized by the NetworkIdentity. Any other state you wish to synchronize across the network needs to go in a NetworkBehaviour inside your GameObject. When an object is created in the server, you must tell Mirage to create it in the clients and keep track of it. This is known as Spawning.","keywords":""},{"title":"Error Handling","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/guides/error-handling","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Overview​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Error Handling","url":"docs/guides/error-handling#overview","content":"The server tracks errors caused by player actions, like malformed RPCs.

Each player has a &quot;bucket&quot; of tokens that represents their error budget. Tokens: When a player causes an error, a cost is deducted from their token bucket. Max Tokens: The capacity of the bucket. A player starts with this many tokens and cannot exceed this limit. A higher limit allows for a burst of errors, for example if something goes wrong in the game for a short amount of time. Refill &amp; Interval: Tokens are replenished over time. Refill specifies how many tokens are restored every Interval (in seconds). Cost: Represents the severity of an error. When an error occurs, this amount is subtracted from the player's tokens. Reaching the Limit: If a player's token count drops below zero, they have exhausted their budget. This triggers the error handling logic, which is a disconnect by default. This system tolerates occasional minor errors while penalizing frequent or severe infractions. On the NetworkServer component, you can configure this behavior: Error Rate Limit Enabled: Toggles the rate-limiting feature. Enabled by default.Error Rate Limit Config: Configures the token bucket (MaxTokens, Refill, Interval).Rethrow Exception: If enabled, exceptions are re-thrown after being logged.

At this window, we will click on a small button that says (probably, at today date on Unity Editor 2021.13f) Packages: In Project, here we have to select My registries.

Since we are not changing scenes between server open or close, we could disable the NetworkSceneManager, but we can leave it as it is. UdpSocketFactory is the one that does the connection, so you can change the IP and port if necessary there. Now let's set up a few things on the scene, to make it look more like a game Add a simple Plane floor with: positions (0, -1, 0)scale (2, 2, 2) Next, we add a GameObject, name with the name StartPosition1 set position (1, 1, 1) We go back to our NetworkManager GO, over Character Spawner component we will change the Player Spawn Method from Random to Round Robin.

Create a capsule in the scene hierarchy and name it PlayerAttach a NetworkIdentity and NetworkTransform component into the capsule.Tick Client Authority on the NetworkTransform This is how our Player GO components should look right now  NOTE: Is not needed to set anything else here, Server Object Manager and Client Object Manager will be set dynamically by Mirage later. Next steps: Add a new Script, call it PlayerScriptThen drag this GO with the mouse into the assets folder (You should probably create a Prefabs folder later as a good practice) and release the mouse there. That will create a Prefab for us. (You can notice this was successful because your GO icon in the scene hierarchy will be blue now)Then delete Player from the scene At this stage, our player is done, so right now we need to tell Mirage who is our player in order to spawn it. So this is very easy, just go to your NetworkManager GO and open (if it is not) Character Spawner, then drag the player prefab we created before in the Player Prefab field.  The last step we will need to do is simple: go to the script we created before (you can go into the assets folder and it will be there) and double click it and it will open your IDE. So what we will need to do is simple: tell how we are moving the user, and also to set the camera as a child of the player. We can do that simply like this: using Mirage; using UnityEngine; namespace GettingStarted { public class PlayerScript : NetworkBehaviour { private void Awake() { Identity.OnStartLocalPlayer.AddListener(OnStartLocalPlayer); } private void OnStartLocalPlayer() { Camera.main.transform.SetParent(transform); Camera.main.transform.localPosition = new Vector3(0, 0, 0); } private void Update() { if (!IsLocalPlayer) { return; } float moveX = Input.GetAxis(&quot;Horizontal&quot;) * Time.deltaTime * 110.0f; float moveZ = Input.GetAxis(&quot;Vertical&quot;) * Time.deltaTime * 4f; transform.Rotate(0, moveX, 0); transform.Translate(0, 0, moveZ); } } }  Press play in Unity editor and... what happened?

To spawn game objects without using the Network Manager, you can handle the Prefab registration yourself via script. Use the ClientScene.RegisterPrefab method to register Prefabs to the Network Manager. using UnityEngine; using Mirage; public class MyNetworkManager : MonoBehaviour { public GameObject treePrefab; public ClientObjectManager; public NetworkClient; public NetworkServer; public ServerObjectManager; void Start() { ClientObjectManager = FindObjectOfType&lt;ClientObjectManager&gt;(); NetworkClient = FindObjectOfType&lt;NetworkClient&gt;(); NetworkServer = FindObjectOfType&lt;NetworkServer&gt;(); ServerObjectManager = FindObjectOfType&lt;NetworkServer&gt;(); } // Register prefab and connect to the server public void ClientConnect() { ClientObjectManager.spawnPrefabs.Add(treePrefab); NetworkClient.Connect(&quot;localhost&quot;); NetworkClient.MessageHandler.RegisterHandler&lt;ConnectMessage&gt;(OnClientConnect); } void OnClientConnect(NetworkConnection conn, ConnectMessage msg) { Debug.Log(&quot;Connected to server: &quot; + conn); } }  In this example, you create an empty game object to act as the Network Manager, then create and attach the MyNetworkManager script (above) to that game object. Create a prefab that has a Network Identity component attached to it, and drag that onto the treePrefab slot on the MyNetworkManager component in the Inspector. This ensures that when the server spawns the tree game object, it also creates the same kind of game object on the clients. Registering prefabs ensures that there is no stalling or loading time for creating the Asset. For the script to work, you also need to add code for the server. Add this to the MyNetworkManager script: public void ServerListen() { // start listening, and allow up to 4 connections NetworkServer.StartServer(); NetworkServer.MessageHandler.RegisterHandler&lt;ConnectMessage&gt;(OnServerConnect); NetworkServer.MessageHandler.RegisterHandler&lt;ReadyMessage&gt;(OnClientReady); } // When client is ready spawn a few trees void OnClientReady(NetworkConnection conn, ReadyMessage msg) { Debug.Log(&quot;Client is ready to start: &quot; + conn); SpawnTrees(); } void SpawnTrees() { int x = 0; for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; ++i) { GameObject treeGo = Instantiate(treePrefab, new Vector3(x++, 0, 0), Quaternion.identity); ServerObjectManager.Spawn(treeGo); } } void OnServerConnect(NetworkConnection conn, ConnectMessage msg) { Debug.Log(&quot;New client connected: &quot; + conn); }  The server does not need to register anything, as it knows what game object is being spawned (and the asset ID is sent in the spawn message). The client needs to be able to look up the game object, so it must be registered on the client. When writing your own network manager, it’s important to make the client ready to receive state updates before calling the spawn command on the server, otherwise, they won’t be sent. If you’re using Mirage’s built-in Network Manager component, this happens automatically. For more advanced uses, such as object pools or dynamically created Assets, you can use the ClientObjectManager.RegisterSpawnHandler method, which allows callback functions to be registered for client-side spawning. See the documentation on Custom Spawn Functions for an example of this. If the game object has a network state like synchronized variables, then that state is synchronized with the spawn message. In the following example, this script is attached to the tree Prefab: using UnityEngine; using Mirage; public class Tree : NetworkBehaviour { [SyncVar] public int numLeaves; void Start() { Identity.OnStartClient.AddLisenter(OnStartClient); } public override void OnStartClient() { Debug.Log(&quot;Tree spawned with leaf count &quot; + numLeaves); } }  With this script attached, you can change the numLeaves variable and modify the SpawnTrees function to see it accurately reflected on the client: void SpawnTrees() { int x = 0; for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; ++i) { GameObject treeGo = Instantiate(treePrefab, new Vector3(x++, 0, 0), Quaternion.identity); Tree tree = treeGo.GetComponent&lt;Tree&gt;(); tree.numLeaves = Random.Range(10,200); Debug.Log(&quot;Spawning leaf with leaf count &quot; + tree.numLeaves); ServerObjectManager.Spawn(treeGo); } }  Attach the Tree script to the treePrefab script created earlier to see this in action.

When a new player joins the game (when a new client connects to the server), that player’s game object becomes a &quot;local player&quot; game object on the client of that player, and Unity associates the player’s connection with the player’s game object. Unity associates one player game object for each person playing the game, and routes networking Server RPC Calls to that individual game object. A player cannot invoke a Server RPC Call on another player’s game object, only their own. The NetworkBehaviour class (which you derive from to create your network scripts) has a property called IsLocalPlayer. On each client’s player game object, Mirage sets that property to true on the NetworkBehaviour script and invokes the OnStartLocalPlayer callback on the object's NetworkIdentity. This means each client has a different game object set up like this because on each client a different game object is the one that represents the local player. The diagram below shows two clients and their local players. Only the player game object that is &quot;yours&quot; (from your point of view as the player) has the IsLocalPlayer flag set. Usually, you should set this flag in the script to determine whether to process input, whether to make the camera track the game object or do any other client-side things that should only occur for the player belonging to that client. Player game objects represent the player (that is, the person playing the game) on the server, and run Server RPC Calls from the player’s client. These Server RPC Calls are secure client-to-server remote procedure calls. In this server-authoritative system, other non-player server-side game objects cannot receive Server RPC Calls directly from client-side game objects. This is both for security, and to reduce the complexity of building your game. By routing all incoming Server RPC Calls from users through the player game object, you can ensure that these messages come from the right place, the right client, and can be handled in a central location. The CharacterSpawner component adds a player every time a client connects to the server. In some situations though, you might want it not to add players until an input event happens - such as a user pressing a “start” button on the controller. To disable automatic player creation, you may want to write your own CharacterSpawner component and wait for the AddPlayerMessage message to be sent from the client.","keywords":""},{"title":"Custom Character Spawning","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/guides/game-objects/spawn-player-custom","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Ready State​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Custom Character Spawning","url":"docs/guides/game-objects/spawn-player-custom#ready-state","content":"Out of date! This is out of date and needs to be updated! In addition to characters, players also have a &quot;scene is ready&quot; state. The server sends clients that are ready information about spawned game objects and state synchronization updates; clients which are not ready are not sent these updates. When a client initially connects to a server, their SceneIsReady property will be true. However initial spawning will not happen until a character has been added or you manually tell the server to send spawned objects. Once a client has completed all its pre-game setup, and all its Assets are loaded, it can send a character message. As seen in the example above this will tell the server to spawn the player's character using ServerObjectManager.AddCharacter. After the character is spawned mirage will automatically send a spawn message for the other spawned object to the client.

The NetworkRoomManager uses this technique to switch from the NetworkRoomPlayer game object to a game-play player game object when all the players in the room are ready. You can also use ReplaceCharacter to respawn a player or change the object that represents the player. In some cases, it is better to just disable a game object and reset its game attributes on respawn. The following code sample demonstrates how to replace the player game object with a new game object: public class CustomCharacterSpawner : MonoBehaviour { public NetworkServer Server; public ServerObjectManager ServerObjectManager; public void Respawn(NetworkPlayer player, GameObject newPrefab) { // Cache a reference to the current character object GameObject oldPlayer = player.Identity.gameObject; var newCharacter = Instantiate(newPrefab); // Instantiate the new character object and broadcast to clients // NOTE: here we can use `keepAuthority: true` because we are calling Destroy on the old prefab immediately after.

This means that even if the player enters a large world with many networked game objects, the game can start quickly because it does not need to spawn every game object that exists in the world. Note that this applies to networked game objects in your scene, but does not affect the loading of Assets. Unity still takes time to load the Assets for registered Prefabs and Scene game objects. When a player moves within the world, the set of network-visible game objects changes. The player’s client is told about these changes as they happen. The ObjectHide message is sent to clients when a game object becomes no longer network-visible. By default, Mirage destroys the game object when it receives this message. When a game object becomes visible, the client receives an ObjectSpawn message, as if Mirage has spawned the game object for the first time. By default, the game object is instantiated like any other spawned game object.

For this reason, it cannot destroy game objects that are not visible to the local player. Instead, there is the virtual method OnSetLocalVisibility in the NetworkVisibility class that is invoked. This method is invoked on all scripts that inherit from NetworkVisibility on game objects that change the visibility state on the host. The default implementation of OnSetLocalVisibility disables or enables all renderer components on the game object. If you want to customize this implementation, you can override the method in your script, and provide new behavior for how the host (and therefore the local client) should respond when a game object becomes network-visible or invisible (such as disabling HUD elements or renderers). "},{"title":"Customizing Network Visibility​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Network Visibility","url":"docs/guides/network-visibility#customizing-network-visibility","content":"Sometimes you might want to use other kinds of visibility checks, such as grid-based rules, line-of-sight tests, navigation path tests, or any other type of test that suits your game. It may be helpful to understand how the Network Proximity Checker works. The Network Proximity Checker is implemented using the public visibility interface of Mirage’s HLAPI. Using this same interface, you can implement any kind of visibility rules you desire. Each NetworkIdentity keeps track of the set of players that it is visible to. The players that a NetworkIdentity game object is visible to are called the “observers” of the NetworkIdentity. The Network Proximity Checker calls the RebuildObservers method on the Network Identity component at a fixed interval (set using the “Vis Update Interval” value in the inspector), so that the set of network-visible game objects for each player is updated as they move around. In the NetworkVisibility class (which your custom observer scripts inherit from), there are some virtual functions for determining visibility. These are: OnCheckObserver This method is called on the server, on each networked game object when a new player enters the game. If it returns true, that player is added to the object’s observers. The Network Proximity Checker does a simple distance check in its implementation of this function and uses Physics.OverlapSphereNonAlloc to find the players that are within the visibility distance for this object.OnRebuildObservers This method is called on the server when RebuildObservers is invoked. This method expects the set of observers to be populated with the players that can see the object. The NetworkServer then handles sending ObjectHide and ObjectSpawn messages based on the differences between the old and new visibility sets.OnSetHostVisibility This method is called on the server by the visibility system for objects on a host. Objects on a host (with a local client) cannot be disabled or destroyed when they are not visible to the local client. So this function is called to allow custom code to hide these objects. A typical implementation will disable renderer components on the object. This is only called on local clients on a host. You can check whether any given networked game object is a player by checking if its NetworkIdentity has a valid Owner. For example: int hitCount = Physics.OverlapSphereNonAlloc(transform.position, visRange, hitsBuffer3D, castLayers); for (int i = 0; i &lt; hitCount; i++) { Collider hit = hitsBuffer3D[i]; NetworkIdentity identity = hit.GetComponent&lt;NetworkIdentity&gt;(); if (identity != null &amp;&amp; identity.Owner != null) observers.Add(identity.Owner); }  "},{"title":"Remote Actions Overview","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/guides/remote-actions/","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Arguments to Remote Actions​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Remote Actions Overview","url":"docs/guides/remote-actions/#arguments-to-remote-actions","content":"Mirage serializes RPC arguments to send them over the network.

The first time a game object is sent to a client, it must include a full state snapshot, but subsequent updates can save on bandwidth by including only incremental changes. The OnSerialize function should return true to indicate that an update should be sent. If it returns true, the dirty bits for that script are set to zero. If it returns false, the dirty bits are not changed. This allows multiple changes to a script to be accumulated over time and sent when the system is ready, instead of every frame. The OnSerialize function is only called for initialState or when the NetworkBehaviour is dirty. A NetworkBehaviour will only be dirty if a SyncVar or SyncObject (e.g. SyncList) has changed since the last OnSerialize call. After data has been sent the NetworkBehaviour will not be dirty again until the next syncInterval (set in the inspector).

The default sync direction is from Server to both Owner and Observers. The directions can be set per NetworkBehaviour, which means that different components can have different sync directions. For example, a PlayerName component can be set to sync from the Owner and a Health component from the Server. Valid sync directions include: Sync from Server to Owner and/or Observers (Default)Sync from Owner to Server and/or ObserversSync from both Owner and Server to Observers onlyNo sync direction (None to None), nothing will be synced. Invalid sync directions include: Sync from None to any directionSync from Owner to None or Server to NoneSync from Server to Owner onlySync from both Owner and Server to Owner only note ObserversOnly excludes the Owner. In order to sync to owner the Owner Flag must be set. If syncing from both Owner and Server at the same time, there will be a race condition. If they both update a value at the same time, they will both send an update to the other side which will set the value and cause them to be out of sync. While this option is allowed, it is advised to only sync from either Server or Owner. [Flags/Bitmasks] The SyncFrom and SyncTo fields are flag enums. This means you can combine multiple values. For example, in SyncTo you can select both Owner and ObserversOnly to send data to both. These enums work as bitmasks, so combining flags is done using a bitwise OR operation. It is important to understand how the None flag works. When you combine None with another flag, like Owner, the result is just Owner, the None flag is essentially ignored. Some UI might display the enum as None | Owner, but this simply means that only the Owner flag is active. "},{"title":"When to use Server to Owner​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Sync Settings","url":"docs/guides/sync/sync-settings#when-to-use-server-to-owner","content":"In some case you don't want some data to be visible to other players. By disabling the ObserversOnly flag Mirage will only send data to the Player that owns the object. For example, suppose you are making an inventory system. Suppose players A, B, and C are in the same area. There will be a total of 12 objects in the entire network, objects in bold are owned by that client: Client A has Player A, Player B, and Player CClient B has Player A, Player B, and Player CClient C has Player A, Player B, and Player CThe server has Player A, Player B, Player C each one of them would have an Inventory component Suppose Player A picks up some loot. The server adds the loot to Player's A inventory, which could have a SyncLists of Items. By default, Mirage now has to synchronize player A's inventory everywhere, which means sending an update message to client A, client B, and client C, because they all have a copy of Player A. This is wasteful, Client B and Client C do not need to know about Player's A inventory, they never see it on screen. It is also a security problem, someone could hack the client and display other people's inventory and use it to their advantage. By only having SyncTo.Owner set the server will only send then Player A's to Client A, Player B's to Client B, etc. It might not seem like much of a waste with only 3 players, but say if you have 50 instead the that is a lot of extra data to sending to each client. Other typical use cases include quests, player's hand in a card game, skills, experience, or any other data you don't need to share with other players.

"},{"title":"When are changes sent?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Sync Settings","url":"docs/guides/sync/sync-settings#when-are-changes-sent","content":"When a value is changed, the corresponding NetworkBehaviour is added to a list of dirty objects. This list is then looped over during each update, and changes are sent while taking the SyncInterval into account. This means that the server only has to loop over a small number of objects each frame - only the objects that have changed. This is a significant improvement in performance, especially when there are a large number of idle network objects. In contrast, other networking solutions like Mirror Networking loop over every object every update, regardless of whether it has changed or not. Because of this improvement, certain tasks can be accomplished more easily in Mirage. For example, if you have a forest with individual trees represented by NetworkIdentity, they will not add any performance cost unless the player interacts with them. This allows you to use RPCs and SyncVars on each tree, making it easier to create network features without needing workarounds for performance reasons.

These methods are never called anywhere. The user gets a warning because they are overriding an obsolete method, which might get ignored if they have lots of other warnings.

NetworkBehaviorSerializers​ NetworkBehaviour​ Base class which should be inherited by scripts which contain networking functionality. NetworkClient​ This is a network client class used by the networking system. It contains a NetworkConnection that is used to connect to a network server. The handle connection state, messages handlers, and connection configuration. There can be many instances in a process at a time, but only one that is connected to a game server () that uses spawned objects. has an internal update function where it handles events from the transport layer. This includes asynchronous connect events, disconnect events and incoming data from a server. NetworkDiagnostics​ Provides profiling information from mirror A profiler can subscribe to these events and present the data in a friendly way to the user NetworkExtensions​ NetworkIdentity​ The NetworkIdentity identifies objects across the network, between server and clients. Its primary data is a NetworkInstanceId which is allocated by the server and then set on clients. This is used in network communications to be able to lookup game objects on different machines. NetworkIdentitySerializers​ NetworkInspectorCallbacks​ Callbacks for NetworkManager​ NetworkManagerGUI​ NetworkManagerHud​ NetworkMatchChecker​ Component that controls visibility of networked objects based on match id. Any object with this component on it will only be visible to other objects in the same match. This would be used to isolate players to their respective matches within a single game server instance. NetworkMessageAttribute​ Tell the weaver to generate reader and writer for a class NetworkMethodAttribute​ Prevents this method from running unless the NetworkFlags match the current state Can only be used inside a NetworkBehaviour NetworkPingDisplay​ Component that will display the clients ping in milliseconds NetworkPlayer​ A High level network connection. This is used for connections from client-to-server and for connection from server-to-client. NetworkPrefabs​ A scriptable object that contains a list of prefabs that can be spawned on the network. NetworkProximityChecker​ Component that controls visibility of networked objects for players. Any object with this component on it will not be visible to players more than a (configurable) distance away. NetworkSceneChecker​ Component that controls visibility of networked objects between scenes. Any object with this component on it will only be visible to other objects in the same scene This would be used when the server has multiple additive subscenes loaded to isolate players to their respective subscenes NetworkSceneManager​ NetworkSceneManager is an optional component that helps keep scene in sync between server and client. The loads scenes as instructed by the . The controls the currently active Scene and any additive Load/Unload. when a client connect NetworkSceneManager will send a message telling the new client to load the scene that is active on the server NetworkServer​ The NetworkServer. NetworkTime​ Synchronize time between the server and the clients NetworkTransform​ NetworkTransformBase​ NetworkTransformBase.DataPoint​ NetworkTransformChild​ A component to synchronize the position of child transforms of networked objects. There must be a NetworkTransform on the root object of the hierarchy. There can be multiple NetworkTransformChild components on an object. This does not use physics for synchronization, it simply synchronizes the localPosition and localRotation of the child transform and lerps towards the received values. NetworkVisibility​ NetworkBehaviour that calculates if the gameObject should be visible to different players or not NetworkWorld​ Holds collection of spawned network objects This class works on both server and client NetworkWorldExtensions​ NetworkedPrefabAttribute​ Forces the user to provide a prefab that has a NetworkIdentity component and is registered. Also provides a fix button to fix the prefab if it hasn't been networked. OnlineOfflineScene​ PendingAsyncSpawn​ PipePeerConnection​ A that directly sends data to a bypassing the transport layer for local host/client communication. PipePeerConnection.PipeConnectionHandle​ Virtual connection handle for internal pipe connections. PlayerSceneChangeEvent​ ReadOnlyInspectorAttribute​ Makes field readonly in inspector. This is useful for fields that are set by code, but are shown iin inpector for debuggiing RecentlyDestroyed​ SceneAttribute​ Converts a string property into a Scene property in the inspector SceneChangeFinishedEvent​ Event fires from INetworkSceneManager when a scene change finishes on either Server or Client.
